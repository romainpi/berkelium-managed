ABOUT:
Berkelium-Managed provides a managed wrapper for the Berkelium library, allowing you to embed
Chromium into applications written in managed languages like C# and VB.net.

It is based on BerkeliumSharp by Kevin Gadd:

BUILDING:
To build Berkelium-managed you first need to apply the patches in patches/ these will fix the
paths of the berkelium projects. (Use 'patch -i XXXX.patch -p 0').

You can then open BerkeliumManaged.sln and build.
